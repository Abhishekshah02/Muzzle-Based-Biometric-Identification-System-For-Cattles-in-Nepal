    "| **Cause of Low Accuracy**                               | **Why It Happens**                                                                                                                           | **Solution / Fix**                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

    "| **1️⃣ Feature instability**                             | Gabor filters are sensitive to changes in lighting, scale, or rotation of the muzzle image. Even small variations change extracted features. | - Apply **image preprocessing**: histogram equalization, Gaussian smoothing.<br>- Use **rotation & scale-invariant descriptors** (e.g., SIFT, SURF, ORB).           |\n",
    "| **2️⃣ Blob features are not distinctive**               | The number of blobs and their intensity values may not uniquely represent each cattle. Many cattle may have similar blob patterns.           | - Use **texture descriptors (LBP, HOG)** instead of blob count.<br>- Increase the number of features extracted per image.                                           |\n",
    "| **3️⃣ No spatial relationship captured**                | Gabor + Blob only give intensity patterns, ignoring the **position of unique muzzle spots**.                                                 | - Use **keypoint-based features (SIFT)** or **CNN embeddings**, which capture spatial patterns better.                                                              |\n",
    "| **4️⃣ Feature scaling mismatch**                        | Some features may dominate others (e.g., mean intensity vs. blob count), affecting cosine similarity.                                        | - Apply **feature normalization (MinMax or L2)** before similarity calculation.                                                                                     |\n",
    "| **5️⃣ Poor train-test split**                           | Some cattle IDs have very few images, causing weak representation in the gallery.                                                            | - Ensure **at least 2–3 images per cattle** in both gallery and test sets.<br>- Augment data (brightness, blur, rotation).                                          |\n",
    "| **6️⃣ Handcrafted features limit discriminative power** | Manual features may not be powerful enough to distinguish 400 unique cattle IDs.                                                             | - Use **deep learning models (ResNet, MobileNet)** to extract embeddings.<br>- Optionally, **fine-tune YOLO backbone** to generate stable cattle-specific features. |\n",
    "| **7️⃣ Noise in dataset**                                | Poor-quality or partially visible muzzles degrade extracted features.                                                                        | - Clean dataset, remove unclear images.<br>- Use ROI cropping to focus only on the muzzle area.                                                                     |\n"
